# health-app
A health app where it gets a health data from a wear Os watch like heart rate and sends this data to the mobile phone app and then this data is sent to HealthConnect app where we can reuse this data.
I used android studio and health connect app api to connect with the app and I used Wearable data layer api to connect the wear os app to phone app.
